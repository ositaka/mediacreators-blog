Iâ€™m Tania Rascia, a full stack software developer, technical writer, and former chef.

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a [career change](/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/). I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
